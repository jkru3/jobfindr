# interview maximization
1. get instant alerts from your top-30 companines when new jobs come out
2. be able to spin up and deploy online tailored resumes to every position
3. (**BONUS**): keep track of the most in demand SWE positions and their skills to iterate on resumes
  - mobile (android/iOS) engineers
    - Swift
  - GraphQL
4. send out requests for referrals to your linkedin contacts
this documentation outlines step number 3. No tech required

## leveraging LinkedIn for referrals
1. make a list of the most prestigous companies in the area
2. in TWO PASSES, connect with a few people starting from least to most prestigous prioritizing
  - ENGINEERS (NOT INTERNS) in the first pass and RECRUITERS in the second
  - 2nd degree connections with lots of mutuals
  - ACTIVE
  - people who look like you (discrimination is real)
  - 500+ connections (more likely to connect with strangers)
  - if they have content, WRITE A PERSONALIZED MESSAGE
  > you will need to do this over a period of several days, because of connection limits. Remember, each company (even if you don't want to work there) potentially connects you with the mutuals of a company you DO want to work at
3. make a top-30 list of companies YOU want to work for and add these to your alerts. when an alert comes in for a job you are qualified, tailor a resume and send it out
4. To continue maintaining your network, you'll need to periodically unconnect from people who aren't aligned with your professional goals. Whitelist people who you actually know (or like). Whitelist prestige companies (which whitelists the people who work at them). Mass de-connect from everyone else
5. FOLLOW the top-100 people who ENGAGE WITH YOUR CONTENT. Unfollow everyone else. This way your feed will be self-reinforcing: only people who actively engage with you will get rewarded
